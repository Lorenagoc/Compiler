# Compiler
Project of a compiler for a fictitious language for the Compilers course at Cefet-MG, taught by Kecia Marques.

A special thanks to Andrei Rimsa, Programming Languages, and Formal Languages and Automata teacher at Cefet-MG, that made available a Tiny interpreter as a reference in Programming Languages, but now have been helpful as well in Compilers (https://github.com/rimsa/tiny).

## Code example: 

```
start
    int a, b;
    int result;
    float a,x,total;
    a = 2;
    x = .1;
    scan (b);
    scan (y);
    result = (a*b ++ 1) / 2;
    print "Resultado: ";
    print (result);
    print ("Total: ");
    total = y / x;
    print ("Total : ";
    print (total);
exit
``` 

## How to run
1. Open the project on IntelliJ
2. Press the run icon :arrow_forward: or use alt+f10 shortcut
3. A dialog input will open
4. Type it a valid file name and press ok.
